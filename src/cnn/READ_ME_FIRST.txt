GENERAL INFORMATION

1) ***CLONE*** the entire directory to your local workspace.

2) ***RUN*** the "dogCatCnn.py" to build, train, test the model
Changing the following parameters will lead to different runtime:

steps_per_epoch = 400
epochs = 20
validation_steps = 162

The larger the parameters, the longer runtime!
